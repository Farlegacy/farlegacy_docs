$SHARD is the connective tissue of Farlegacy's entire ecosystem, shaping how players progress, interact, and stand out. Whether you're climbing ranks, personalizing your identity, or leading a clan to victory, $SHARD is the fuel behind the experience. Here's how it functions across the game:

Every $SHARD spent on:

* Event entries
* Cosmetic items
* Clan creation or expansion is burned, permanently removing it from circulation.

This deflationary loop helps maintain long-term value and scarcity.
