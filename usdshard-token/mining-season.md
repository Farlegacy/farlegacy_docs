# Mining Season

{% hint style="info" %}
Mining Season marks the first official event in Farlegacy, created to reward our earliest adventurers and rally the community ahead of launch.
{% endhint %}

Instead of waiting on the sidelines, youâ€™ll dive in from day one as you mine NFT chests, bring friends into the world of Farlegacy, and get ready for the full launch.

***

## How It Works

Players can participate through a mini-app integrated directly into Farcaster. Once connected, you'll be able to mint a special NFT chest every 8 hours. Each chest contains a share of the $SHARD token supply, to be revealed and distributed after the event concludes.

{% hint style="info" %}
Chests are unopenable until the end of the season.
{% endhint %}

To claim your rewards, you'll need to own a Crystal NFT, making Mining Season both an engagement event and a gateway into the Farlegacy economy.
