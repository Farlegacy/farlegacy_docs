# Guide

Farlegacy isn’t just a card game. It’s a world. And like in any world, you’ll want to know where to click, what to collect, and how to actually get inside. This guide will take you step by step, from “just browsing” to “locked in and already deep in the fight.”

## Getting Access

Before anything else, you’ll need a key, literally.

To play Farlegacy, you must own a Crystal NFT. These NFTs act as access passes, representing your identity, your entry point, and your crystal in-game.

Don’t have one yet? The public sale is coming soon. Keep an eye on our official channels for the announcement, giveaways, and whitelist opportunities.

## Platform & Ecosystem

Farlegacy is:

* Built on the Base blockchain (L2, via Optimism)
* Available exclusively via Warpcast (farcaster-native access)

To play, you’ll need:

* Access to [Warpcast ](https://warpcast.com/)(download from [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/warpcast/id1600555445) / [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.farcaster.mobile))
* A wallet, and here’s the good part: the built-in Warpcast wallet is enough. No need to connect an external wallet unless you want to.
* A small amount of ETH on Base for gas (used during minting or advanced interactions, but not required just to play)

***

## Basic Game Concept

Your objective: Destroy the opponent’s crystal before they destroy yours.

* Both players start with 40 HP on their crystals.
* You play cards from a hand of 5.
* Each turn gives you 5 energy to spend.
* You can attack, defend, heal, and manipulate effects using cards.
* Some cards have unique mechanics that can reflect, bypass, or stack effects over time.

Every match is turn-based and lasts about 8–12 minutes.

***

## Your Cards

Cards are drawn automatically from your deck.

* You start with a basic deck (20 cards as a new player).
* Max deck size: 40 cards.
* Each turn: you draw 5 new cards.
* After 8 turns (40 cards), your deck reshuffles.
* Cards fall into four categories:
  * Attack
  * Defense
  * Ultimate (utility/special)
  * Heal

You don’t need to build a custom deck to start. You’ll have enough to play immediately.

***

## Turn Mechanics

Each turn follows this simple flow:

1. Draw 5 cards
2. Get 5 energy
3. Play cards (any number, if energy allows)
4. End turn → opponent’s turn

Some cards trigger effects over multiple turns (like Burn or Buff). Others affect what you’ll draw next.

Cards do not stay in hand. They refresh every turn. Plan ahead.

***

## Status Effects

Here are some effects you’ll encounter frequently:

* Evade: Negates incoming attacks (1 or more)
* Burn: Deals 1 damage per turn for X turns
* Reflect: Returns fixed damage back to the attacker
* Energy Buff: +1 or +2 energy per turn
* Draw Mods: Manipulate future draws, recycle cards, or fetch from discard

These effects can stack or cancel depending on card interactions.

***

## Tips for First Matches

* Learn your deck. Know which cards are defensive vs. offensive.
* Don’t spend all your energy every turn. Sometimes timing wins games.
* Stack buffs before going in for a heavy attack.
* Keep an eye on your opponent’s crystal and what they might be saving.
* Heal strategically. Sometimes 2 HP is the difference between victory and collapse.

***

## How to Actually Play (UI)

Once in-game:

* Your crystal is displayed at the bottom center of the screen
* Your HP is shown directly beneath the crystal
* Your 5-card hand appears below that
* Cards display their energy cost and effect icon
* Tap a card → view full description
* Drag & drop or tap to play
* End turn manually or wait for the timer (45 seconds)
