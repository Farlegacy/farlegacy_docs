# Refferrals

Referrals play a special role in Farlegacy's pre-launch ecosystem. During early campaigns like [Mining Season](mining-season.md), the referral system rewards community-driven growth, amplifies visibility, and helps prepare the project for full game launch.

**Note:** Everything described below applies specifically to pre-launch reward campaigns. In-game referral systems, if introduced, will be detailed separately after the game is live.
{% endhint %}

## How It Works

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Refferal Reward.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

Players can generate a unique referral code during campaigns like Mining Season and beyond. Each code has a limited number of uses. When someone joins using your code, they become your referral.

You earn extra rewards when referrals remain active and complete specific campaign actions.

Each referral code starts with 5 activations. Once you reach the limit, there is a 48-hour cooldown, after which the code resets with 5 new activations. This system keeps things fair and encourages long-term participation.
