# Rewards System

{% hint style="info" %}
Rewards are one of the core mechanics that tie together gameplay, progression, and community engagement. \
\
In this section, we'll explain how the reward system works and how you can earn $SHARD simply by playing.

## Reward Allocation

Out of the total supply of 100,000,000 $SHARD, 65% (equal to 65,000,000 tokens) is allocated to the rewards system. These tokens are dedicated to rewarding players for their activity, progression, and participation in events.

## Ways to Earn $SHARD

Here at Farlegacy, we want to give players more flexibility and choice. That's why you can earn tokens through three main paths:

1. **Leveling Up:** Every time you [level up](levels.md) your account, you receive a reward. These rewards include $SHARD tokens and loot boxes containing new cards. The reward system is designed to be exponential â€” the higher your level, the more tokens and loot boxes you earn with each milestone.
2. **Completing Weekly Quests:** New quests become available each week. By completing them, you can earn various rewards. Depending on the type and difficulty of the quest, the reward may be XP or $SHARD tokens. More details on the quest system can be found [here](quests.md).
3. **Leaderboards:** Farlegacy features a competitive [leaderboard system](leaderboard.md). By climbing the ranks and reaching top placements, players earn a share of the prize pool. The higher you rank, the greater your rewards. There are two types of leaderboards: Seasonal and Event-based.

## Earning Rewards

The smart wallet connected to your Farcaster account and Crystal NFT serves as your in-game identity. It receives everything you earn automatically:

* Tokens from quests
* Tokens for leveling up
* Rewards from leaderboards

There is no need to trigger transactions, copy addresses, or manually confirm anything.

You focus on playing. Your smart wallet collects the rewards. After that, you can use your tokens in the game, or withdraw and sell them on DEXs.
