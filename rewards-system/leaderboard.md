# Leaderboard

{% hint style="info" %}
Leaderboards track the top-performing players and clans across Farlegacy, depending on the type of leaderboard. They are updated regularly and tied to rewards, prestige, and competition.
{% endhint %}

## Leaderboard Types

There are two main types of leaderboards in the game, each of which comes in both clan and individual formats:

## Seasonal Leaderboards

The Seasonal Leaderboards are at the heart of Farlegacy’s competitive cycle. Each season spans two weeks, giving both solo players and clans a recurring chance to earn recognition and rewards.

### Duration and Structure

* Season length: 14 days
* Resets: At the end of each season, rankings undergo a partial reset, allowing top players to maintain momentum while giving others a chance to climb

### Reward Pools

### Individual Rewards Breakdown

The prize pool is divided among the top 200 players as follows:

* Top 10: 33.33% of the pool, split equally
* Ranks 11–50: 33.33% of the pool, split equally
* Ranks 51–200: 33.33% of the pool, split equally

This ensures meaningful rewards across a broad range of competitors, while heavily rewarding those who reach the top.

### Clan Rewards Breakdown

The 500,000 $SHARD Clan prize pool is distributed between the top 5 Clans:

1st place — 30%\
2nd place — 25%\
3rd place — 20%\
4th place — 15%\
5th place — 10%

Within each Clan, rewards are divided proportionally based on each member’s Trophy contribution.

**Important:** To be eligible for Clan leaderboard rewards, a player must be a member of the Clan before the season begins.

## Event Leaderboards

Event Leaderboards are dynamic, time-limited competitions tied to special game modes or challenges. Unlike their seasonal counterparts, they adjust to the unique rules and objectives of each event.

### Flexible Formats

Every event introduces its own gameplay twist — from modified deck rules to special win conditions. As a result, each leaderboard feels different, and rewards players who can quickly adapt.

* Events may last from a few days to a full week
* Rules, matchmaking, and scoring systems are customized per event
* Some events may feature unique card restrictions or modifiers

### Rewards & Prize Pools

The prize pool for each Event Leaderboard is determined individually and announced alongside the event details.

* Size and structure of rewards vary depending on event type and duration
* Include only Individual or Clan leaderboards
* Rewards can include $SHARD, cosmetics, or exclusive cards

{% hint style="info" %}
Not every event is the same, and those who read the rules carefully will have the upper hand.
