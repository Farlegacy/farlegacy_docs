## About

Ð¡rystals is the heart of Farlegacy. Only by possessing one of them can you gain access to this universe. It unlocks access to battles with other players, quests and rewards. Each crystal is an NFT on Base, and each one is unique. The total supply is strictly limited to 10,000. \
\
How do you get one? Well, that part will be revealed soon. For now, we suggest staying close.

## Why crystals, you ask?

Why not, say, a biometric drone with the face of a pigeon, or a multidimensional cube with an attitude? Honestly, no one really remembers. But somehow, these strange little things, glowing like an overheated synth at a warehouse rave, ended up being your ticket into the game.

Some say the crystals are ancient tech, remnants from long-lost blockchain civilizations. Others claim they were created by accident, when someone spilled an energy drink on a smart contract. As usual, the truth probably lies somewhere in between (or somewhere completely else).
