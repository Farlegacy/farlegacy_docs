# Crystals

{% hint style="info" %}
Crystals are the only way to access Farlegacy. Your identity. Your access. Your power.
{% endhint %}

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/Crystals2.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

## What are Crystals?

Crystals are the foundational asset of Farlegacy, a collection of exactly 10,000 NFTs on Base. They are not optional, and they are not cosmetic. If you want to play, earn, compete or contribute, it begins here.

Each Crystal is a permanent on-chain proof that you belong in this universe.

## Utility

These are the core utilities tied to Crystal ownership:

***

## Golden Crystals

Out of 10,000 Crystals, 100 are Golden. These NFTs are visually distinct and grant holders a share of all trading fees from the entire collection. This makes them both a collectible and a source of passive on-chain rewards.

### Trading Fee Rewards

* Golden holders receive 1% each from 100% of secondary market royalties
* Rewards are sent automatically to the holder's Farcaster-linked in-game wallet
* No claiming or action required â€” just hold to earn

{% hint style="info" %}
Royalty rate and payout schedule will be announced before mint.
{% endhint %}

## DAO Voting

Crystal holders can influence the future of Farlegacy through on-chain voting. This includes decisions on new cards, seasonal events and other ecosystem updates.

The process is simple, transparent, and directly tied to Crystal ownership.

### Voting Mechanics

* **1 Crystal = 1 Vote**\
  Your voting power increases with the number of Crystals you hold
* **Voting cap: 7 votes per user**\
  Even if you own more, only up to 7 Crystals can be used per vote to ensure fairness and decentralization
* **On-chain by design**\
  All votes are recorded and executed on the Base network, with full visibility and immutability

### Anonymous Voting (Optional)

Farlegacy supports private voting.&#x20;

When you choose to vote anonymously:

* Your vote is encrypted automatically at the moment of submission
* It is stored on-chain in encrypted form
* The vote is counted in the final result without revealing your identity or choice during the voting period
* Once voting ends, the system verifies and decrypts the data to produce final results

{% hint style="info" %}
You can choose between public and anonymous voting before casting your vote.
{% endhint %}

## Stacking

In Farlegacy, holding multiple Crystals provides enhanced benefits through a stacking system.\
This mechanic encourages committed players to expand their collection while keeping gameplay balanced.

### Reward Multiplier

* Holding more Crystals increases your in-game reward rate
* The multiplier applies to XP and all in-game rewards, excluding future airdrops
* **Maximum stacking cap: 7 Crystals**\
  Holding more than 7 does not increase your multiplier further

<table><thead><tr><th align="center">Crystals Held</th><th align="center" valign="middle">Reward Multiplier</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="center">1</td><td align="center" valign="middle">1.0x</td></tr><tr><td align="center">2</td><td align="center" valign="middle">1.3x</td></tr><tr><td align="center">3</td><td align="center" valign="middle">1.6x</td></tr><tr><td align="center">4</td><td align="center" valign="middle">2.0x</td></tr><tr><td align="center">5</td><td align="center" valign="middle">2.5x</td></tr><tr><td align="center">6</td><td align="center" valign="middle">3.0x</td></tr><tr><td align="center">7 or more</td><td align="center" valign="middle">3.5x (max)</td></tr></tbody></table>

{% hint style="info" %}
Holding more Crystals increases your XP and in-game rewards up to 3.5x at full stack.
{% endhint %}

### Additional Stacking Benefits

Additional stacking benefits such as profile badges, cosmetic upgrades, clan perks, and access to exclusive features are planned for future updates. These bonuses will reward collectors beyond gameplay multipliers and will be gradually introduced over time.

### Anti-Exploitation Logic

* All stacking bonuses are wallet-bound
* Crystals must be held continuously in the wallet during the season to apply stacking
* Snapshot logic may be used for fairness in event-based rewards
