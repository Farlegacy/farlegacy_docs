# Mining Season

{% hint style="info" %}
Mining Season marks the first official event in Farlegacy, created to reward our earliest adventurers and rally the community ahead of launch.
{% endhint %}

Instead of waiting on the sidelines, you’ll dive in from day one as you mine NFT chests, bring friends into the world of Farlegacy, and get ready for the full launch.

## 12.5% Reserved for Rewards

<figure><img src=".gitbook/assets/12.png" alt=""><figcaption></figcaption></figure>

From the total supply of 100,000,000 $SHARD tokens, 12.5% (12,500,000 $SHARD) has been allocated to Mining Season. This makes it one of the most significant reward phases in the early lifecycle of the project.

The goal is to recognize early supporters and help build a thriving community of committed players ahead of launch.

***

## How It Works

Mining Season centers around a simple but rewarding loop:

{% hint style="info" %}
&#x20;Each chest contains a share of the $SHARD token supply, to be revealed and distributed after the event concludes.&#x20;
{% endhint %}

***

## Leaderboard Competition

Mining Season features a public leaderboard where players compete by minting as many chests as possible before the event ends. Each minted chest not only increases your individual rewards but also boosts your position in the overall ranking.

Referrals indirectly impact your score by helping you mint more — every invited player who participates brings you closer to the top. The most consistent participants can expect extra recognition, exclusive whitelist access for Crystal minting, and a potential edge in future phases of Farlegacy.

***

## Referrals

Every participant receives a unique referral code with limited activations (5 invites per cycle). Once a code is used 5 times, it refreshes after 48 hours, allowing you to invite more users.

Each successful referral earns you bonus NFT chests, increasing your final $SHARD conversion.

## Claiming Rewards

To convert your NFT chests into $SHARD tokens at the end of Mining Season, you must hold at least one Crystal NFT either in your Farcaster in-app wallet or in a Farcaster-verified external wallet.

The more Crystals you own, the higher your reward multiplier. Each eligible chest you collect during the event will yield more $SHARD tokens if you hold multiple Crystals by the time the campaign ends.
