# Rules

Farlegacy is a turn-based, onchain card battler set in a cyberpunk world where players use their decks to destroy the opponent’s crystal. While the action may feel fast and chaotic, the underlying rules are simple, strategic, and designed for depth.

Below is everything you need to know to play and survive.

***

## Objective

Each player starts with 40 HP on their crystal. The goal is to reduce the opponent's crystal health to 0 before they do the same to yours.

***

## Game Structure

* 1v1 format: Two players face off.
* Turn-based: Players alternate turns, one action phase at a time.
* Each player has:
  * A crystal (your base HP, starting at 40)
  * A deck (maximum 40 cards)
  * A hand of 5 cards (refreshed each turn)
  * A shared energy system (used to play cards)

***

## Energy System

* Players begin each turn with 5 energy points.
* Each card costs a set amount of energy to play.
* Unused energy does not carry over between turns.
* Some cards can modify your energy generation over time (+1 or +2 energy on future turns, etc.).

***

## Card Types

There are four main types of cards in Farlegacy:

#### 1. Attack Cards

* Deal direct damage to the opponent's crystal.
* Some bypass defenses like evade.
* Some deal damage over multiple turns.

#### 2. Defense Cards

* Reduce or block incoming damage.
* Some provide evade (dodging attacks entirely).
* Evade blocks one or more attacks unless otherwise bypassed.

#### 3. Ultimate Cards

* Feature special or advanced mechanics.
* May modify card draws, energy, timing, or damage multipliers.
* These cards often shift the momentum of the game.

#### 4. Heal Cards

* Restore health to your crystal.
* Some also remove negative status effects.

## Turn Flow

Each turn consists of the following phases:

1. **Draw Phase:**\
   Your hand refreshes with 5 new cards from your deck. You cannot retain cards between turns.
2. **Energy Allocation:**\
   You receive 5 energy (or more, if enhanced by effects).
3. **Action Phase:**\
   You play as many cards as you want, as long as you have the energy to pay for them. Card effects resolve immediately unless otherwise stated (e.g. delayed damage or next-turn draws).
4. **End Phase:**\
   All cards used this turn are sent to the discard pile. Effects marked as “for X turns” are updated. Ongoing effects such as burn or buffs continue.

***

## Match Timing & Turn Limits

* A typical match lasts between 8 to 12 minutes, depending on the pace and strategy of both players.
* Each player has up to 45 seconds to complete their turn.
* If no cards are played within that time, the turn ends automatically.
* Timers ensure steady game flow and prevent stalling in high-stakes situations.

***

## Deck & Card Cycling

* A player’s deck consists of up to 40 cards.
* After 8 turns (i.e., 40 cards drawn), the deck is reshuffled automatically.
* You start with a base deck (e.g. 20 cards as a new player).
* Cards may include duplicates, especially for balance.

***

## Status Effects

Here are the common temporary effects applied to your crystal or the opponent's:

* **Evade:** Blocks the next incoming attack. Some cards can pierce evade.
* **Burn (EL):** Deals 1 damage per turn for a set number of turns.
* **Reflect:** Reflects incoming damage back to the attacker. Usually fixed (e.g. 2 damage reflected).
* **Energy Buff:** Adds +1 or +2 energy on your turn for a limited time.
* **Draw Manipulation:** Certain cards allow you to recall, replace, or preview future cards.

***

## Victory & Defeat

* The first player to reduce their opponent’s crystal to 0 HP wins.
* If both crystals hit 0 HP in the same turn, the player who dealt the final damage first wins.

***

## Other Mechanics

* **Unplayable States:** If you can’t afford any card in your hand, you end the turn without action. Strategic passes are allowed.
* **Combo Effects:** Some cards are best used in combination (e.g. BOOST before an attack card).
* **Deck Customization (future):** Players will eventually be able to build custom decks using owned cards.

***

## Tips

* Damage stacks fast. Sometimes it's better to block than strike.
* Knowing when to play utility cards can swing an entire match.
* Use card effects to cycle your deck and recover key plays.

Farlegacy blends simplicity with depth and rewards those who learn the rhythm of control, pressure, and timing. Your cards are more than just tools. They’re pieces of the story.
