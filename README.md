If you want to learn where it all came from and how it began, we suggest starting with the LORE OF THE FARLEGACY.

## What is Farlegacy?

In short — it’s a card game. But not just any card game. It’s a cyberpunk-styled card battler built on Base and available exclusively on Warpcast. Each card is inspired by the key heroes, characters, and iconic projects from the Base, Farcaster, and broader crypto culture ecosystems.

Farlegacy doesn’t ask you to be a crypto wizard or a deck-building mastermind. But if you are — great, you’ll feel right at home. And if you’re not — you’re still welcome. Just remember one thing: if a card ever winks at you from the screen, it’s either a bug… or you’ve already gone too deep.

## The Vision

At its core, Farlegacy is an experiment — not just in gameplay, but in how games are discovered, entered, and experienced in the age of onchain culture.

We imagine a world where games are more than just entertainment — they’re living ecosystems, shaped by communities and deeply rooted in the lore and identity of the networks they’re built on. Farlegacy doesn’t just built on Base — it belongs to Base. Every card, mechanic, and shard of its world draws inspiration from the culture brewing across Farcaster, Base, and the broader crypto space.

Our goal is simple: to make the player feel like they've stumbled upon something strange, a bit mysterious, but frighteningly appealing. Something that isn't immediately explained, but sticks. If after the first game you're not thinking "how to win?" but "what the hell was that?" — then it's working properly.
