If you want to learn where it all came from and how it began, we suggest starting with the LORE OF THE FARLEGACY.

## What is Farlegacy?

In short, it's a card game. But not just any card game. It's a cyberpunk-styled card battler built on Base and available exclusively on Warpcast. Each card draws inspiration from key heroes, characters, and iconic projects across the Base, Farcaster, and the broader crypto culture ecosystem.

Farlegacy doesn’t expect you to be a crypto wizard or a deck-building mastermind. If you are, great. You’ll feel right at home. If you're not, you're still welcome. Just remember one thing: if a card ever winks at you from the screen, it’s either a bug… or you’ve already gone too deep.

## The Vision

At its core, Farlegacy is an experiment. Not just in gameplay, but in how games are discovered, accessed, and experienced in the era of onchain culture.

We imagine a world where games are more than entertainment. They become living ecosystems, shaped by communities and deeply connected to the lore and identity of the networks they grow from. Farlegacy is not simply built on Base, it belongs to it. Every card, mechanic, and fragment of its world is inspired by the culture emerging across Farcaster, Base, and the broader crypto space.

Our goal is simple: to make the player feel like they've stumbled upon something strange, a bit mysterious, but frighteningly appealing. Something that isn't immediately explained, but sticks. If after the first game you're not thinking "how to win?" but instead find yourself wondering "what the hell was that?" then it’s working properly.
