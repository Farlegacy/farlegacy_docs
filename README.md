## About the Game

Farlegacy was born from a simple but powerful idea. What if we could bring the entire crypto world into one living system?

A world where founders, memes, projects, and communities all coexist as playable characters. A city shaped by shared history and collective memory. A battleground where your knowledge of culture is just as important as your strategic skill. We wanted to create something that felt alive. Something that could only exist in crypto.

This is a game built for people who were here. People who remember the forks, the rugs, the Discord raids. People who stayed when others left. Farlegacy is not about nostalgia. It is about building something new on top of everything that came before. A shared myth forged in battles, alliances, and on-chain records.

## The Vision

Farlegacy was never built to be a quick trend or just another game on the chain. It was designed from day one as an ecosystem rooted in culture, strategy, and community. Every system, every mechanic, every piece of lore reflects a deep respect for crypto's chaotic, creative spirit.

We believe that games can be more than entertainment. They can be onchain playgrounds for identity, collaboration, and competition. They can preserve history while inventing new futures. That's why $SHARD, our native token, isn't just a reward system. It's the connective tissue that links players, creators, and builders into a shared economy of value and meaning.

The long-term vision is clear. We want to create a living, breathing ecosystem powered by people. A world where every win and loss is recorded, every card tells a story, and every battle adds to something greater. Farlegacy is here to reshape what on-chain games can become
