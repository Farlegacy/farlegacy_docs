## About the Game

Each card in the game is inspired by key figures, personalities, and iconic characters from the Base, Farcaster, and broader crypto culture. These aren’t abstract references. They’re familiar faces, projects, and memes reimagined as game mechanics.

This world doesn’t try to explain itself. But the deeper you go, the more it starts to make sense, or at least feel like it should.

## The Vision

At its core, Farlegacy is an experiment. Not just in gameplay, but in how games are discovered, accessed, and experienced in the era of onchain culture.

We imagine a world where games are more than entertainment. They become living ecosystems, shaped by communities and deeply connected to the lore and identity of the networks they grow from. Farlegacy is not simply built on Base, it belongs to it. Every card, mechanic, and fragment of its world is inspired by the culture emerging across Farcaster, Base, and the broader crypto space.

Our goal is simple: to make the player feel like they've stumbled upon something strange, a bit mysterious, but frighteningly appealing. Something that isn't immediately explained, but sticks. If after the first game you're not thinking "how to win?" but instead find yourself wondering "what the hell was that?" then it’s working properly.
