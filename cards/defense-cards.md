# Defense cards

{% hint style="info" %}
Defense won’t win you the game. But it sure stops you from losing it.
{% endhint %}

Farlegacy currently includes 8 defense cards, 5 of which are unique. Their main color is orange, a tone that represents resilience, boldness, and the ability to take a hit. More may emerge over time as the meta shifts and the community helps define what it means to survive. Below is the current list of available cards in this category.

### FARCASTER

Not just a shield. A statement. Farcaster isn’t here to stall a turn. It’s here to hold the line when everything else is burning. Carved into the card is the iconic arch, a symbol of open protocol, digital permanence, and absolute refusal to fold.

When this shield rises, it’s not about defense. It’s about presence.

### SHIELD V1

{% hint style="info" %}
This card has a duplicate.
{% endhint %}

The lightest shield in the game. Cheap, quick, and often underestimated. Don’t count on it to save you forever, but in the right moment, it buys you just enough time to change everything.

### SHIELD V2

{% hint style="info" %}
This card has a duplicate.
{% endhint %}

Still modest, but a little more confident. Shield V2 is what happens when you realize surviving one more turn might be all you need. Gentle in tone, but stubborn by nature.

### SHIELD V3

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1067.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption><p>Green means go nowhere.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

{% hint style="info" %}
This card has a duplicate.
{% endhint %}

Balanced and dependable. V3 is the defense you play when things are getting serious, when you need to hold the line and buy some real space to breathe.

***

### SHIELD V4

<div align="left"><figure><img src="../.gitbook/assets/IMG_1068.PNG" alt="" width="188"><figcaption><p>Red. Heavy. Final word.</p></figcaption></figure></div>

This one doesn’t flinch. Shield V4 isn’t flashy. It’s focused. When everything’s falling apart, it plants its feet and says, “Not yet.”
