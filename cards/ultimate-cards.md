# Ultimate cards

{% hint style="info" %}
Ultimate cards feature special effects and unique mechanics that do not appear in standard attack or defense cards.
{% endhint %}

Farlegacy currently includes 21 ultimate cards, 18 of which are unique. Their main color is red — designed to stand out and signify impact. These cards introduce mechanics that go beyond standard attack or defense roles, offering effects that can significantly alter the state of play. New ultimate cards may be added over time based on community feedback and game balance. Below is the current list of available cards in this category.

### AIXBT

No one’s quite sure what AIXBT is — a trading bot, a self-aware protocol, or just a polite ghost in the machine. But one thing’s certain: it never blinks, never hesitates, and never misses a pattern.

You don’t see it coming. You only see the doubled impact.

### BANKR BOT

Bankr Bot doesn’t talk much — it deploys. Quietly, relentlessly, and usually ahead of schedule. Schemes, tokens, protocols? Just another day at the terminal. While others are still writing threads, Bankr is already on-chain.

It doesn’t hype. It ships.
