## About

Farlegacy currently features 60 total cards, including 40 unique ones, split across four main categories:

<table><thead><tr><th width="86.99993896484375">Type</th><th align="center">Attack cards</th><th align="center">Defense cards</th><th align="center">Ultimate cards</th><th align="center">Heal cards</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Amount</td><td align="center">22 pcs.</td><td align="center">8 pcs.</td><td align="center">21 pcs.</td><td align="center">9 pcs.</td></tr><tr><td>Ð¡olor</td><td align="center">Purple</td><td align="center">Orange</td><td align="center">Red</td><td align="center">Green</td></tr></tbody></table>

Some of the cards have duplicates. This is to allow players to be more selective in assembling their own deck based on their strategy and also to achieve a better game balance.

## Key card indicators

Each card displays up to three core stats:

{% hint style="info" %}
If a card doesn't deal damage or grant defense, only its energy cost will be shown.
{% endhint %}

## **Starter Deck**

Every new player in Farlegacy begins their journey with a randomly generated starter deck of 20 cards. This deck is designed to offer a balanced mix of gameplay elements, allowing players to immediately jump into battles and start learning the game.

While the cards are randomized, the system ensures that each deck remains well-rounded and fair.&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
These cards cannot be traded or sold.
{% endhint %}

## Earning New Cards

In Farlegacy, building your collection is a key part of progression. Players unlock new cards primarily through loot boxes, which contain randomized cards across different types such as attack, defense, healing, and ultimate.

### How to Get Loot Boxes

There are two main ways to earn loot boxes:

### Loot Box Mechanics

In the current version of the game, each loot box contains a single card. The card is selected completely at random, and there is a chance of receiving a duplicate (if applicable).

{% hint style="info" %}
Loot box rarities and expanded mechanics will be introduced in future updates.
{% endhint %}

## Deck Building

Every player in Farlegacy constructs their own deck to bring into battle. Decks are built using unlocked cards and can be customized to reflect your strategy and playstyle.

* Minimum deck size: 20 cards
* Maximum deck size: 40 cards
* Players are free to build decks of any size within this range
* All cards in a deck are drawn randomly during matches, so balance and consistency matter

There are no restrictions on card types or combinations. Whether you prefer aggressive attack setups, utility-heavy control, or balanced hybrids, your deck is entirely your own.

{% hint style="info" %}
Decks can be saved, edited, and switched out between battles.
{% endhint %}

Each card is designed to support a variety of playstyles and tactical decisions. Whether you prefer aggressive attacks, defensive setups, healing strategies, or powerful ultimates, the right combination of cards can shift the outcome of any match. Mastering how different cards interact and when to play them is key to building a competitive and effective deck.
