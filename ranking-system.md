## Rank Structure

Players are placed into ranks based on their Trophy count. Winning ranked battles earns you Trophies, while losses deduct them. As you accumulate more Trophies, you ascend through the following ranks:

* **Initiate** (0–299 Trophies)\
  You're just getting started. Learn the flow of battle and experiment with strategies.
* **Seeker** (300–599 Trophies)\
  You've made it through your first tests. Expect tougher opponents and tighter matches.
* **Operator** (600–999 Trophies)\
  You know what you’re doing — and so does everyone else here. Strategy matters.
* **Architect** (1000–1499 Trophies)\
  Your influence is growing. These battles often determine who climbs and who stalls.
* **Overseer** (1500–1999 Trophies)\
  You are now part of the elite. Precision and coordination decide every match.
* **Echo** (2000+ Trophies)\
  Top-tier status. Legends are written here. Expect to face the best of the best.

Note: Trophy numbers may be adjusted during balancing and season resets.

## Season Resets

At the end of each season, all ranks undergo a partial Trophy reset. Higher-ranked players retain more of their progress, while lower ranks start closer to the base. This ensures fair competition at the start of each new season while maintaining a sense of progression for dedicated players.
